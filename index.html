                    and is the region’s only postsecondary institution, serving a population of 250,000,
                    including the City of Belleville, City of Quinte West, Municipality of Brighton, Prince

                    of a regional concentration of interconnected communities, employers, institutions,

                    and community services, Loyalist’s programming and curriculum are designed to

                    In March 2021, as part of regional mass
                    vaccination efforts, Loyalist College and
                    Hastings Prince Edward Public Health
                    (HPEPH) worked together to establish
                    a Regional Immunization Centre at
                    Loyalist’s Belleville campus. College
                    staff and faculty worked tirelessly to
                    help ensure the seamless distribution
                    of vaccines to community members,

                    surged in December 2021, students,
                    faculty, and staff once again dropped
                    everything to erect another clinic within
                    24 hours and administered over 10,000
                    booster shots.<br><br>

                    Close ties with local public health
                    services have also allowed the College to
                    create better opportunities for students
                    to engage with their community and
                    learn in the field. More than 90 students

                    In the first year of the pandemic, we
                    quickly redesigned our Student Success
                    services to allow for seamless online
                    delivery. This past fiscal year, many of
                    these services were delivered in a hybrid
                    modality in order to meet students
                    where they are – whether that is onsite
                    for socially distanced labs, or remotely,
                    due to programs that continued to be
                    delivered online. As the College began
                    to bring students and employees back
                    to campus in Fall 2021, we were able
                    to continue delivering personalized
                    supports to meet the diverse needs of
                    students, reflecting our Destination
                    College vision.<br><br>

                        Loyalist supported our on campus and surrounding community members by being the
                        first regional destination for mass COVID-19 vaccinations throughout the pandemic.
                        In partnership with GO-VAXX, our campus served as a mobile destination site for
                        vaccinations. Numerous students across a variety of Loyalist College programs were
                        enlisted to support the operations of the on-campus clinic, providing them with a
                        valuable real-world, work-integrated learning experience. The students were also
                        instrumental in supporting a holiday season vaccination acceleration initiative. <br><br>

                    <p class="text">
                        Prior to the implementation of the College’s mandatory vaccination policy, rapid testing
                        was provided onsite for anyone who had not yet been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
                        Implementing the mandatory vaccine policy aligned with the College’s objectives. Later,
                        during the Winter semester Study Week, a rapid testing clinic was run out of Residence
                        to quickly identify any cases on campus. <br><br>

                        The results of the implementation of this project have been so amazing
                        to see that I have decided to continue working on a volunteer basis to
                        support with their portfolio development. It has been incredible to see the
                        progress and changes that this project has made for the youth, and I’m so
                        excited to see what they accomplish in the future. Loyalist staff and faculty
                        involved in this program are a huge reason why this program has been so
                        successful – they were so helpful in guiding us through the development
                        of the project, coordinating meetings with JHS and training us to be PLAR
                        facilitators.

                    When the Government of Ontario
                    announced that publicly-assisted
                    colleges could offer standalone four-year
                    degrees in Nursing, Loyalist mobilized its
                    expertise in nursing education to launch
                    the region’s first standalone Honours
                    Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree
                    program. The new degree, which will
                    welcome its first cohort of nursing
                    students in September 2022, gives
                    local students a unique opportunity to
                    complete a four-year nursing degree
                    without needing to leave the Bay of
                    Quinte region. With numerous hospital
                    expansions currently underway in the
                    region, there is significant demand for
                    experienced medical staff. This growth
                    has led to an abundance of work
                    placement opportunities, as well as
                    strong pathways to employment after
                    graduation.<br><br>

                        Working in The Centre for Natural
                        Products and Medical Cannabis
                        has truly been an honour. As a
                        Loyalist alumna, I am most proud
                        of returning to Loyalist College to
                        continue my career path through
                        this once-in-a-lifetime project. Being
                        selected as the Mitacs Research
                        Intern for the Royal Development
                        Group project, has given me an
                        opportunity that most people will
                        never be given: the opportunity to
                        send something to the International
                        Space Station. If someone were
                        to tell my younger self that I
                        would be sending something into
                        space, I probably wouldn’t believe
                        them because it is such a surreal
                        experience. For that reason, I am
                        extremely thankful to the Loyalist
                        College community for supporting
                        me through my academic journey
                        and my professional development. As a student, the Biosciences
                        faculty encouraged me to
                        become the best scientist I could
                        be in the lab and the classroom,
                        and they believed in me when
                        I didn’t believe in myself. As an
                        employee of the College, the staff
                        and faculty from The Centre of
                        Natural Products and Medical
                        Cannabis have continued to
                        provide me with support, which
                        has increased my confidence in
                        my skills and contributed to the
                        project’s success.

                    In 2020, when 48 manufacturing
                    companies took part in a
                    Manufacturing Workforce
                    and Technology Study, 92% of
                    respondents indicated that they
                    understood the need to undergo
                    industrial transformation. They
                    also indicated that employee skill/
                    knowledge was a major obstacle
                    in undergoing this evolution. That
                    year, Loyalist College mobilized to
                    help support the manufacturing
                    sector in overcoming these
                    challenges and closing the skillsgap, developing a two-year
                    Electromechanical Engineering
                    Technician – Mechatronics
                    program. To support hands-on

                    equipment, portion of the secondlevel hall in Bay of Quinte Skills
                    Centre was transformed into a
                    state-of-the-art Mechatronics lab,
                    and the program launched in Fall
                    2021

                        With the clear need and
                        opportunity identified, Team
                        Loyalist developed a unique
                        program based on industry
                        needs. We knew the program
                        needed to be nimble, flexible,
                        attractive to new students
                        and provide opportunities to
                        upskill the current workforce.

                        has answered the call. This
                        year, the first-ever cohort of
                        the Mechatronics program

                        studies, with a second cohort
                        of students set to begin in Fall
                        2022. We’re proud to see the

                            essential skills to network and
                            communicate effectively. I feel

                        The project was my idea, and
                        it took me a lot of research and
                        hard work to put this story
                        together. A lot of time and effort
                        was put into developing the idea,
                        and it was refined over several
                        weeks with a constantly changing
                        focus. I am proud to be one of
                        the finalists in the Canadian
                        Association of Journalists’ 2021
                        Awards Conference. My article
                        has been nominated amongst the
                        top five finalists for the Student
                        Excellence Award category. My
                        editor, Professor Andy Clarke,
                        was interested in my pitch and
                        approved it in our morning story
                        meeting. The piece was vetted by
                        Professor Katherine Sedgwick,
                        and she gave it the final magical
                        touches. Loyalist’s QNet News
                        was my home for a year and the
                        website gave me a platform to
                        display my work and to become
                        the voice of Belleville.

                    In the Ministry Policy Binding Directive – Governance and Accountability Framework,
                    under Advisory College Council, the Board of Governors is to ensure that an

                    students and employees of the College to provide advice to the President on matters
                    of importance to students and employees. The Board of Governors is to ensure that

                    In the fiscal year 2021-2022, the primary focus of Loyalist College Council was to
                    provide advice on the establishment of a framework around Equity, Diversity and
                    Inclusion (EDI). The Council undertook in-depth work to develop and understand
                    aspects of diversity and how this impacts the lived experiences of our community
                    members in their day-to-day. These learnings provide us with a better knowledge
                    base to understand how our policies, procedures, physical spaces and infrastructure
                    represent our diverse College campus community and surrounding communities. <br><br>

                        It is hard to believe that we navigated
                        through another year of a global
                        health crisis; however, as this fiscal
                        Annual Report showcases, remarkable
                        progress was made between April
                        1, 2021 and March 31, 2022, despite
                        these ongoing challenges. Guided by
                        our <a style="color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration:underline;"
                            href="https://www.loyalistcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Loyalist-College-Strategic-Plan-2025.pdf">Strategic

                            Mandate Agreement 3</a>, we continued
                        to make progress in institutional
                        excellence and student success as we
                        advanced our collective Destination
                        College vision. We want to acknowledge
                        the remarkable resilience and
                        determination of our Loyalist College
                        employees who remained singularly
                        focused on ensuring our students
                        were successful in their postsecondary
                        journeys while protecting the health and
                        well-being of both our on-campus and
                        surrounding communities.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Caring has been embedded in Loyalist’s
                        DNA for years; however, no period in the
                        College’s history has cut closer to the
                        heart of our foundational values, nor
                        tested our resolve so completely, as the
                        global pandemic. While Loyalist College
                        is among the smallest of Ontario’s 24
                        public colleges, our size has never
                        held us, or our students, back. We
                        have leveraged our small size into our
                        greatest advantage, and that is because
                        we care deeply about each other and our
                        broader community. With the launch of
                        our new brand and manifesto this year,
                        we are leaning into the fact that “small
                        gives us the power to do big things.”<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="text">
                        “Small” means we are nimble, adaptable,
                        and capable of moving mountains to help
                        each and every student succeed. Small
                        also means connection to the needs of
                        our region, employers, and our industry
                        partners. The deep-rooted connections
                        and meaningful relationships our
                        students and employees have with
                        community and industry partners
                        makes Loyalist College a destination for
                        applied research and entrepreneurship,
                        creating a hub of innovation that is
                        responsive to industry’s evolving needs.<br><br>

                    <p class="text">
                        A primary achievement this year was
                        the approval to offer a standalone
                        Honours Bachelor of Science in
                        Nursing degree, which recognizes our
                        longstanding leadership in developing a
                        homegrown health care workforce and
                        the deep partnerships we have built
                        with Quinte Health Care and Hastings
                        Prince Edward Public Health. Together,
                        we have supported the community and
                        partnered in ways we never imagined
                        possible – including the launch of a
                        Regional Immunization Clinic which
                        saw 50,000 vaccines administered by
                        students, supervised by Public Health,
                        from March to August 2021. And again,
                        as the Omicron variant surged in
                        December 2021, Loyalist students and
                        employees worked with Public Health
                        to erect another Immunization Clinic
                        within 24 hours that resulted in 10,000
                        booster shots administered.<br><br>

                        in natural beauty products, testing
                        horticulture applications for deep
                        space exploration, or investigating the
                        genome’s role in the future of farming,
                        Loyalist College is working at the cuttingedge of innovation in sectors that will

                        These achievements did not happen
                        in spite of our small size, but because
                        of it. Our close-knit, interconnected
                        network of research experts and
                        community partners provide the ideal
                        supportive and responsive launchpad
                        for big ideas. To a skills-focused College
                        that emphasizes hands-on learning and real-world experience to prepare our
                        students for success in the workplace,
                        COVID-19 created a unique set of
                        challenges for faculty and staff, but
                        our core institutional values - caring,
                        inclusive, engaging, accountable, and
                        creative - helped us come together
                        in support of our students and
                        surrounding communities.<br><br>

                        As we traversed through the global

                        stronger partnerships, reinforced our
                        values, and ended up in a far better
                        position to embark on a post-pandemic
                        future than we ever expected was
                        possible. We look forward to building on

                        In early 2022, in anticipation of a fullscale return to on-campus and in-person
                        operations, the President convened
                        a working group to explore a series
                        of “signature” on-campus events and
                        experiences that would be delivered
                        between March 1 - April 30, 2022.
                        These events would help to signal the
                        resumption of in-person activity to both
                        students and employees, and present
                        an opportunity for the entire College to
                        reflect on the achievements of the past
                        two years.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The working group was co-chaired by
                        two CET members and included crossfunctional representation from a number
                        of units and departments including
                        Student Life (Athletics and Residence
                        Life), Career Services, International,
                        Marketing and Communications, IT
                        Services, and Planning and Sustainability.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        For many students, March 2022 marked
                        the first time that they would have had an
                        on-campus experience – including those
                        students who would graduate just a few
                        months later in June. These events and
                        this eight-week window of time allowed
                        for Loyalist to reinforce our values as
                        a caring community and ensure that
                        students felt welcome, supported, and
                        connected. With the recognition that
                        these eight weeks could inform lasting
                        memories and a deepened sense of
                        connection to Loyalist, it was important
                        to deliver inclusive, impactful, and
                        transformative programming.<br><br>
